# Contract Awards DataÂ Analysis

1. Business Understanding
The World Bank Group's Corporate Procurement Unit is responsible for the coordination and oversight of the sourcing strategy, selection, and contract execution for goods, services, construction, and consulting services in over 150 offices around the world. In this project we will focus on the dataset provided by The World Bank Group's Corporate Procurement Unit.

The objective of this project is to analyze dataset Corporate Procurement Contract Awards. The given dataset is used by the Corporate Procurement Unit while ensuring that procurement awards are consistent with procurement policies and procedures, as business units are accountable for the business need, expenditure policy, requirement specification, and supplier selection.

Through this post we will try to find answers to the questions:

Q1. Is there any link between the supplier contract numbers and the award amount?
Q2. What are the words the most used to describe a contract?
Q3. Is there any relationship between the contract description and the award amount?

The answers to these questions  are searched in the data_analysis.ipynb notebook.
